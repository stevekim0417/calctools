    </table>

    <h2 id="eligibility">Eligibility Requirements</h2>

    <p>To claim the Child Tax Credit, your child must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following requirements:</p>

    <div class="eligibility-check">
      <h4>✅ Qualifying Child Checklist</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Under 17 at the end of the tax year (December 31, 2026)</li>
        <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> Your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, sibling, step-sibling, or a descendant of any of these (grandchild, niece, nephew)</li>
        <li><strong>Residency:</strong> Lived with you for more than half the tax year</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Did not provide more than half of their own support</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent:</strong> Is claimed as your dependent on your tax return</li>
        <li><strong>Citizenship:</strong> Is a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. resident alien</li>
        <li><strong>Social Security Number:</strong> Has a valid SSN issued before your return's due date</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>The Social Security Number Requirement</h3>

    <p>The child <strong>must</strong> have a valid Social Security Number (SSN) to qualify for the Child Tax Credit. An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) or Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN) does not qualify for the CTC, though such children may qualify for the Credit for Other Dependents.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ Important: SSN Timing</h4>
      <p>The child's SSN must be issued by the due date of your return (including extensions). If you're still waiting for an SSN, file an extension to give yourself more time.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Taxpayer Requirements</h3>

    <p>You (the taxpayer claiming the credit) must also meet certain requirements:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You must have a valid identification number (SSN or ITIN)</li>
      <li>You cannot file as "Married Filing Separately" unless specific exceptions apply</li>
      <li>Your modified adjusted gross income must be below the phase-out limits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="income-limits">Income Limits and Phase-Outs</h2>

    <p>Unlike many tax credits, the Child Tax Credit has relatively high income limits, meaning most middle and upper-middle-class families qualify for the full amount.</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Filing Status</th><th>Full Credit Up To</th><th>Credit Fully Phases Out At</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Jointly</td><td>$400,000</td><td>$440,000 (1 child) / $480,000 (2 children)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Single / Head of Household</td><td>$200,000</td><td>$240,000 (1 child) / $280,000 (2 children)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Separately</td><td>$200,000</td><td>$240,000 (1 child)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>How the Phase-Out Works</h3>

    <p>The credit reduces by <strong>$50 for every $1,000</strong> (or fraction thereof) that your modified AGI exceeds the threshold.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>📊 Phase-Out Example</h4>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Married couple with 2 children, MAGI of $425,000</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Amount over threshold: $425,000 - $400,000 = $25,000</li>
        <li>Phase-out amount: $25,000 ÷ $1,000 × $50 = $1,250</li>
        <li>Original credit: $2,000 × 2 = $4,000</li>
        <li>Credit after phase-out: $4,000 - $1,250 = <strong>$2,750</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 id="refundable">Refundable vs. Non-Refundable Credit</h2>

    <p>Understanding the difference between refundable and non-refundable credits is crucial:</p>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Key Difference:</strong> A non-refundable credit can only reduce your tax to $0. A refundable credit can result in a tax refund even if you owe no taxes.
    </div>

    <h3>The Child Tax Credit Structure</h3>

    <p>The $2,000 Child Tax Credit is split into two parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Non-refundable portion:</strong> Up to $1,700 can only reduce tax owed to $0</li>
      <li><strong>Refundable portion (Additional Child Tax Credit/ACTC):</strong> Up to $1,700 can be refunded</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Calculating the Refundable Portion</h3>

    <p>The refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) is calculated as 15% of your earned income over $2,500, up to the maximum refundable amount.</p>

    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Earned Income - $2,500) × 15% = ACTC (max $1,700 per child)</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>📊 ACTC Example</h4>
      <p><strong>Situation:</strong> Single parent, 1 child, $25,000 earned income, $0 tax liability</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Earned income over $2,500: $25,000 - $2,500 = $22,500</li>
        <li>15% of excess: $22,500 × 15% = $3,375</li>
        <li>Maximum ACTC: $1,700</li>
        <li><strong>Refundable credit received: $1,700</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <h2 id="how-to-claim">How to Claim the Child Tax Credit</h2>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Gather information:</strong> Child's name, SSN, date of birth, and relationship to you</li>
      <li><strong>Complete Form 1040:</strong> Enter child information in the dependents section</li>
      <li><strong>Fill out Schedule 8812:</strong> "Credits for Qualifying Children and Other Dependents"</li>
      <li><strong>Calculate the credit:</strong> Schedule 8812 will determine your total credit amount</li>
      <li><strong>Enter on Form 1040:</strong> The credit is reported on line 19 (CTC) and line 28 (ACTC if refundable)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Required Documentation</h3>

    <p>While you don't need to submit documentation with your return, keep records in case of an audit:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Child's birth certificate</li>
      <li>Social Security card</li>
      <li>School or medical records showing residency</li>
      <li>Records showing you provided support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="odc">Credit for Other Dependents</h2>

    <p>Children who don't qualify for the Child Tax Credit may still qualify for the <strong>Credit for Other Dependents (ODC)</strong>:</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Credit for Other Dependents</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Amount</strong></td><td>$500 per qualifying dependent</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Refundable?</strong></td><td>No (non-refundable only)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Who Qualifies</strong></td><td>Children 17+, parents, other qualifying relatives, children with ITINs</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Income Limits</strong></td><td>Same as CTC ($200K single / $400K MFJ)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Who Qualifies for ODC?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Children age 17 or 18 (too old for CTC)</li>
      <li>Children 19-24 who are full-time students</li>
      <li>Children without valid SSN (but with ITIN)</li>
      <li>Elderly parents you support</li>
      <li>Other qualifying relatives living with you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="examples">Real-World Examples</h2>

    <h3>Example 1: Middle-Class Family</h3>
    <p><strong>The Johnsons:</strong> Married filing jointly, 3 children (ages 5, 8, 12), MAGI $95,000</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All 3 children qualify (under 17, valid SSNs)</li>
      <li>Income is below $400,000 threshold</li>
      <li>Total Child Tax Credit: <strong>$6,000</strong> ($2,000 × 3)</li>
      <li>Full credit reduces their tax liability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example 2: High-Income Family</h3>
    <p><strong>The Smiths:</strong> Married filing jointly, 2 children (ages 4, 7), MAGI $450,000</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both children qualify</li>
      <li>Income exceeds $400,000 by $50,000</li>
      <li>Phase-out: ($50,000 ÷ $1,000) × $50 = $2,500</li>
      <li>Original credit: $4,000</li>
      <li>Credit after phase-out: <strong>$1,500</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example 3: Low-Income Family</h3>
    <p><strong>Maria:</strong> Single parent, 1 child (age 6), earned income $18,000, $0 federal tax liability</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Child qualifies for CTC</li>
      <li>ACTC calculation: ($18,000 - $2,500) × 15% = $2,325</li>
      <li>Maximum ACTC: $1,700</li>
      <li>Since Maria owes no tax, she receives: <strong>$1,700 refund</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example 4: Mixed Ages</h3>
    <p><strong>The Garcias:</strong> Married filing jointly, children ages 10, 17, and 21 (student), MAGI $120,000</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10-year-old: Qualifies for CTC ($2,000)</li>
      <li>17-year-old: Does NOT qualify for CTC (must be under 17), but qualifies for ODC ($500)</li>
      <li>21-year-old student: Qualifies for ODC if dependent ($500)</li>
      <li>Total credits: <strong>$3,000</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="changes">Recent Changes and History</h2>

    <h3>Brief History of the CTC</h3>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Year</th><th>Changes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1997</td><td>CTC created at $500 per child</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2001-2017</td><td>Gradually increased to $1,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2018-2025</td><td>TCJA increased to $2,000, raised income limits</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2021 only</td><td>Temporary expansion to $3,000/$3,600 (American Rescue Plan)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2025+</td><td>OBBBA made $2,000 credit permanent, increased refundable portion</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>The 2021 Expansion (Now Expired)</h3>
    <p>For tax year 2021 only, the Child Tax Credit was temporarily expanded to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for children under 6), made fully refundable, and delivered via monthly advance payments. This expansion has expired and does not apply to 2026.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ 2026 Rules Apply</h4>
      <p>The expanded 2021 rules (higher amounts, monthly payments, full refundability) are no longer in effect. For 2026, the standard $2,000 credit with $1,700 refundable applies.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="related">Related Tax Benefits for Families</h2>

    <h3>Child and Dependent Care Credit</h3>
    <p>Separate from the CTC, this credit helps offset childcare costs for working parents. For 2026, you can claim 20-35% of up to $3,000 in expenses for one child ($6,000 for two or more) depending on your income.</p>

    <h3>Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)</h3>
    <p>Lower-income families may also qualify for the EITC, which provides substantial refundable credits. The EITC and CTC can be claimed together.</p>

    <h3>Dependent Care FSA</h3>
    <p>Through your employer, you can set aside up to $5,000 pre-tax for childcare expenses. This provides tax savings separate from the credits above.</p>

    <h3>Education Credits</h3>
    <p>For older children in college, the American Opportunity Credit (up to $2,500) and Lifetime Learning Credit (up to $2,000) can help offset tuition costs.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can divorced parents both claim the Child Tax Credit?</h3>
    <p>No. Only the parent who claims the child as a dependent can claim the CTC. Generally, this is the custodial parent, though Form 8332 can transfer the dependency exemption to the non-custodial parent.</p>

    <h3>What if my child turns 17 during the year?</h3>
    <p>Age is determined as of December 31. If your child turns 17 at any point during 2026, they do not qualify for the Child Tax Credit that year (but may qualify for the Credit for Other Dependents).</p>

    <h3>Can I claim the CTC if I live abroad?</h3>
    <p>U.S. citizens living abroad can claim the CTC if they meet all requirements. The child must have a valid SSN, not an ITIN.</p>

    <h3>Do I need to report advance payments?</h3>
    <p>The monthly advance payments were only available in 2021. For 2026, there are no advance CTC payments — you claim the full credit when you file your tax return.</p>

    <h3>What if my income varies year to year?</h3>
    <p>The credit is calculated based on your income for the tax year you're filing. If your income was high last year but lower this year, you may qualify for a larger credit this year.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>The Child Tax Credit remains one of the most valuable tax benefits for families in 2026. Key points to remember:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>$2,000 per child</strong> under age 17 with a valid SSN</li>
      <li><strong>Up to $1,700 refundable</strong> even if you owe no taxes</li>
      <li><strong>High income limits:</strong> $400,000 for married couples, $200,000 for single filers</li>
      <li><strong>$500 Credit for Other Dependents</strong> for children 17+ and other qualifying relatives</li>
      <li>Claim using <strong>Schedule 8812</strong> attached to your Form 1040</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Make sure you have valid Social Security Numbers for all qualifying children before filing, and keep documentation of residency and support in case of questions from the IRS.</p>
