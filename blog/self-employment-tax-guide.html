    <h2 id="what-is">What Is Self-Employment Tax?</h2>
    
    <p>Self-employment tax is essentially the <strong>Social Security and Medicare taxes</strong> that self-employed individuals must pay. When you work for an employer, these taxes (called FICA) are split 50/50 between you and your employer. But when you're self-employed, you pay <em>both</em> halves.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>📊 Self-Employment Tax Components</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Social Security:</strong> 12.4% on earnings up to $176,100 (2026 wage base)</li>
        <li><strong>Medicare:</strong> 2.9% on all earnings (no cap)</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Medicare:</strong> 0.9% on earnings over $200,000 (single) / $250,000 (married)</li>
        <li><strong>Total SE Tax:</strong> 15.3% (+ 0.9% additional Medicare if applicable)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>This is <em>in addition to</em> your regular federal and state income taxes. So a self-employed person can easily face a combined marginal rate of 35-50% or more when including SE tax, federal income tax, and state income tax.</p>

    <h2 id="who-pays">Who Pays Self-Employment Tax?</h2>

    <p>You owe self-employment tax if you have <strong>net self-employment income of $400 or more</strong> during the year. This includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Freelancers and independent contractors</strong> (receive 1099-NEC forms)</li>
      <li><strong>Gig workers:</strong> Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, Fiverr, Upwork, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Sole proprietors</strong> running their own business</li>
      <li><strong>Partners</strong> in a partnership (their distributive share)</li>
      <li><strong>Single-member LLC owners</strong> (unless elected to be taxed as a corporation)</li>
      <li><strong>Side hustlers</strong> with income from selling goods/services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who Doesn't Pay SE Tax?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>W-2 employees (employer pays their share)</li>
      <li>S-Corp shareholders on their salary portion (but must pay on distributions if salary is unreasonably low)</li>
      <li>Passive income like rental income (in most cases)</li>
      <li>Investment income (dividends, interest, capital gains)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rates-2026">2026 Self-Employment Tax Rates</h2>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Tax Component</th><th>Rate</th><th>Income Cap</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Social Security</strong></td><td>12.4%</td><td>$176,100 (2026)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Medicare</strong></td><td>2.9%</td><td>No limit</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Additional Medicare</strong></td><td>0.9%</td><td>Over $200K single / $250K married</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Social Security Wage Base:</strong> The 2026 Social Security wage base is $176,100. Once your combined wages and self-employment income exceed this amount, you stop paying the 12.4% Social Security portion. Medicare tax continues on all earnings with no cap.
    </div>

    <h2 id="calculate">How to Calculate Self-Employment Tax</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Calculate Net Self-Employment Income</h3>
    <p>Start with your gross self-employment income and subtract all legitimate business expenses:</p>
    <p><strong>Net SE Income = Gross Income − Business Expenses</strong></p>

    <h3>Step 2: Apply the 92.35% Factor</h3>
    <p>The IRS allows you to calculate SE tax on only 92.35% of your net earnings (equivalent to the employer-half deduction that W-2 workers get):</p>
    <p><strong>SE Tax Base = Net SE Income × 0.9235</strong></p>

    <h3>Step 3: Calculate Social Security Portion</h3>
    <p>Apply the 12.4% Social Security rate to the lesser of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your SE Tax Base, OR</li>
      <li>$176,100 minus any W-2 wages already subject to Social Security</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Calculate Medicare Portion</h3>
    <p>Apply the 2.9% Medicare rate to your entire SE Tax Base (no cap).</p>
    <p>If applicable, add 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on amounts over the threshold.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Add Together</h3>
    <p><strong>Total SE Tax = Social Security Tax + Medicare Tax + Additional Medicare (if any)</strong></p>

    <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
    <p>Let's say you're a single freelancer with $100,000 in net self-employment income:</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Step</th><th>Calculation</th><th>Amount</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Net SE Income</td><td>Given</td><td>$100,000</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SE Tax Base</td><td>$100,000 × 0.9235</td><td>$92,350</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Social Security</td><td>$92,350 × 12.4%</td><td>$11,451</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Medicare</td><td>$92,350 × 2.9%</td><td>$2,678</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Total SE Tax</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>$14,129</strong></td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ Don't Forget Income Tax!</h4>
      <p>The $14,129 above is ONLY self-employment tax. You'll also owe federal income tax on your earnings, minus deductions. For this $100,000 example, federal income tax might add another $10,000-$15,000+, depending on your situation.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <h2 id="quarterly">Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments</h2>

    <p>Unlike W-2 employees who have taxes withheld automatically, self-employed individuals must pay taxes throughout the year via <strong>quarterly estimated payments</strong>.</p>

    <h3>2026 Quarterly Payment Deadlines</h3>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Quarter</th><th>Income Period</th><th>Payment Due</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Q1</td><td>Jan 1 – Mar 31</td><td>April 15, 2026</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Q2</td><td>Apr 1 – May 31</td><td>June 15, 2026</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Q3</td><td>Jun 1 – Aug 31</td><td>September 15, 2026</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Q4</td><td>Sep 1 – Dec 31</td><td>January 15, 2027</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>How Much to Pay Quarterly</h3>
    <p>To avoid underpayment penalties, you must pay the lesser of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>90%</strong> of your current year tax liability, OR</li>
      <li><strong>100%</strong> of your prior year tax liability (110% if AGI was over $150,000)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Safe Harbor Method</h3>
    <p>The simplest approach: pay 100% (or 110%) of last year's total tax divided by four. This guarantees no underpayment penalty, even if you earn more this year.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> If your income varies significantly, you can use the "annualized income installment method" to pay less in quarters when you earned less. This is more complex but can improve cash flow.
    </div>

    <h3>How to Make Payments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>IRS Direct Pay:</strong> irs.gov/payments (free, direct from bank account)</li>
      <li><strong>EFTPS:</strong> Electronic Federal Tax Payment System</li>
      <li><strong>Credit/Debit Card:</strong> Through approved processors (fees apply)</li>
      <li><strong>Check:</strong> Mail Form 1040-ES with payment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="deductions">Deductions to Reduce Your Tax Burden</h2>

    <p>One major advantage of self-employment is the ability to deduct legitimate business expenses, which reduces both your income tax AND self-employment tax.</p>

    <h3>Self-Employment Tax Deduction</h3>
    <p>You can deduct <strong>50% of your SE tax</strong> from your gross income. This is an "above-the-line" deduction that reduces your AGI.</p>

    <h3>Common Business Expense Deductions</h3>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Category</th><th>Examples</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Home Office</strong></td><td>Portion of rent/mortgage, utilities, internet (simplified: $5/sq ft up to 300 sq ft)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Equipment</strong></td><td>Computer, phone, software, furniture (can depreciate or use Section 179)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Travel</strong></td><td>Business trips, flights, hotels, 50% of business meals</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Vehicle</strong></td><td>Business mileage (70¢/mile for 2026) or actual expenses</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Professional Services</strong></td><td>Accounting, legal, consulting fees</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Insurance</strong></td><td>Professional liability, business insurance</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Marketing</strong></td><td>Advertising, website, business cards</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Courses, books, conferences related to your business</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Health Insurance Deduction</h3>
    <p>Self-employed individuals can deduct 100% of health insurance premiums for themselves, spouse, and dependents — including dental and long-term care. This is an above-the-line deduction.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>🏠 Home Office Deduction</h4>
      <p>If you use part of your home <strong>regularly and exclusively</strong> for business, you can deduct a portion of housing costs. Two methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplified:</strong> $5 per square foot, max 300 sq ft = up to $1,500</li>
        <li><strong>Regular:</strong> Calculate actual expenses (rent/mortgage interest, utilities, insurance, repairs) based on percentage of home used for business</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="retirement">Retirement Accounts for the Self-Employed</h2>

    <p>Contributing to retirement accounts is one of the best ways to reduce both income tax and self-employment tax while building wealth.</p>

    <h3>Solo 401(k)</h3>
    <p>The most powerful option for self-employed individuals with no employees:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Employee contribution:</strong> Up to $23,500 (2026)</li>
      <li><strong>Employer contribution:</strong> Up to 25% of compensation</li>
      <li><strong>Total max:</strong> $70,000 (or $77,500 with catch-up for 50+)</li>
      <li>Can include Roth option</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SEP IRA</h3>
    <p>Simple to set up and administer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contribute up to 25% of net self-employment earnings (after SE tax deduction)</li>
      <li>Maximum: $70,000 (2026)</li>
      <li>Traditional (tax-deductible) contributions only</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>SIMPLE IRA</h3>
    <p>Good for small businesses with employees:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Employee contribution: Up to $16,500</li>
      <li>Employer match or non-elective contribution required</li>
      <li>Lower limits than Solo 401(k) or SEP</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Solo 401(k) vs. SEP IRA:</strong> For most self-employed individuals without employees, a Solo 401(k) allows higher contributions at lower income levels. SEP IRAs are simpler but only allow employer contributions (25% of compensation).
    </div>

    <h2 id="business-structure">Choosing the Right Business Structure</h2>

    <p>Your business structure affects how much self-employment tax you pay:</p>

    <h3>Sole Proprietorship / Single-Member LLC</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All net income subject to SE tax</li>
      <li>Simplest structure, lowest compliance costs</li>
      <li>Best for lower-income businesses</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>S-Corporation Election</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay yourself a "reasonable salary" → subject to payroll tax</li>
      <li>Remaining profits pass through as distributions → NO SE tax</li>
      <li>Can save significant taxes at higher income levels</li>
      <li>More compliance requirements (payroll, separate tax return)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: S-Corp Savings</h3>
    <p>Net business profit: $150,000</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Structure</th><th>SE/Payroll Tax Base</th><th>Approx SE/Payroll Tax</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Sole Proprietor</td><td>$138,525 ($150K × 92.35%)</td><td>~$19,600</td></tr>
        <tr><td>S-Corp ($80K salary)</td><td>$80,000</td><td>~$12,240</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Savings</strong></td><td></td><td><strong>~$7,360/year</strong></td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ "Reasonable Salary" Requirement</h4>
      <p>S-Corp owners must pay themselves a reasonable salary based on industry standards. The IRS can reclassify distributions as wages if your salary is unreasonably low, resulting in back taxes and penalties.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="forms">Tax Forms You'll Need to File</h2>

    <h3>As a Self-Employed Individual</h3>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Do I have to pay self-employment tax if I already have a full-time W-2 job?</h3>
    <p>Yes, if your net self-employment income is $400 or more. However, you may hit the Social Security wage base cap ($176,100) from your combined income, which would reduce the SE tax on your side income.</p>

    <h3>Can I deduct business expenses even if I don't itemize?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Business expenses on Schedule C are separate from itemized deductions. You can take the standard deduction AND deduct business expenses.</p>

    <h3>What if I can't afford to pay quarterly estimated taxes?</h3>
    <p>You'll owe interest and penalties on underpaid taxes. Set aside 25-30% of each payment you receive for taxes to avoid cash flow problems. Consider opening a separate savings account for taxes.</p>

    <h3>How do I know if I should elect S-Corp status?</h3>
    <p>Generally, S-Corp election makes sense when net business income exceeds roughly $50,000-$80,000 AND the tax savings exceed the additional compliance costs ($1,000-$2,000/year for accountant, payroll service, etc.). Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.</p>

    <h3>Are LLC members subject to self-employment tax?</h3>
    <p>Single-member LLCs are treated as sole proprietorships for tax purposes — yes, SE tax applies. Multi-member LLCs (partnerships) may have more complex rules. LLCs that elect S-Corp or C-Corp taxation follow different rules.</p>

    <h3>What happens if I don't pay self-employment tax?</h3>
    <p>You'll face penalties and interest on unpaid amounts. Serious non-compliance can lead to IRS collections actions, wage garnishment, or liens.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    
    <p>Self-employment tax is a significant consideration for freelancers, contractors, and small business owners. Key takeaways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>SE tax rate is 15.3%</strong> (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare) on 92.35% of net earnings</li>
      <li><strong>Make quarterly payments</strong> to avoid underpayment penalties (Apr 15, Jun 15, Sep 15, Jan 15)</li>
      <li><strong>Deduct business expenses</strong> aggressively but legitimately to reduce your tax base</li>
      <li><strong>Consider S-Corp election</strong> at higher income levels to reduce SE tax</li>
      <li><strong>Max out retirement accounts</strong> (Solo 401(k), SEP IRA) to reduce taxable income</li>
      <li><strong>Set aside 25-30%</strong> of income for taxes throughout the year</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Planning ahead and understanding your obligations is the key to managing self-employment taxes without stress. Consider working with a tax professional who specializes in self-employment to maximize your deductions and ensure compliance.</p>
