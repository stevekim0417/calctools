    <p>Choosing between a <strong>Roth IRA</strong> and a <strong>Traditional IRA</strong> is one of the most important retirement planning decisions you'll make. Both offer powerful tax advantages, but they work in fundamentally different ways. The right choice depends on your current income, expected future tax rates, and retirement goals.</p>

    <p>This comprehensive guide breaks down everything you need to know to make the smartest choice for your financial future.</p>

    <h2 id="basics">The Fundamental Difference</h2>
    
    <p>The core difference between Roth and Traditional IRAs comes down to <strong>when you pay taxes</strong>:</p>

    <div class="comparison-grid">
      <div class="comparison-card">
        <h4>📘 Traditional IRA</h4>
        <p><strong>Tax-deferred</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contribute pre-tax dollars</li>
          <li>Get tax deduction NOW</li>
          <li>Pay taxes LATER (in retirement)</li>
          <li>Withdrawals taxed as ordinary income</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="comparison-card roth">
        <h4>📗 Roth IRA</h4>
        <p><strong>Tax-free growth</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contribute after-tax dollars</li>
          <li>No tax deduction now</li>
          <li>Pay taxes NOW, not later</li>
          <li>Qualified withdrawals 100% tax-free</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 The Simple Rule:</strong> If you expect to be in a <em>higher</em> tax bracket in retirement, choose Roth. If you expect to be in a <em>lower</em> tax bracket, choose Traditional.
    </div>

    <h2 id="comparison">Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Traditional IRA</th><th>Roth IRA</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>2026 Contribution Limit</strong></td><td>$7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)</td><td>$7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)</td></tr>

    <h2 id="limits">2026 Contribution and Income Limits</h2>

    <h3>Contribution Limits (Same for Both)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Under age 50:</strong> $7,000 per year</li>
      <li><strong>Age 50 or older:</strong> $8,000 per year (includes $1,000 catch-up)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the <em>combined</em> limit for all your IRAs. If you have both Traditional and Roth IRAs, your total contributions across all accounts cannot exceed this limit.</p>

    <h3>Roth IRA Income Limits for 2026</h3>
    
    <p>Your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA phases out at higher incomes:</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Filing Status</th><th>Full Contribution</th><th>Reduced Contribution</th><th>No Contribution</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Single/Head of Household</td><td>Under $150,000</td><td>$150,000 - $165,000</td><td>$165,000+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Jointly</td><td>Under $236,000</td><td>$236,000 - $246,000</td><td>$246,000+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Separately</td><td>$0</td><td>$0 - $10,000</td><td>$10,000+</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>💡 Backdoor Roth IRA</h4>
      <p>If your income exceeds Roth limits, you can still get money into a Roth through the "backdoor" strategy: contribute to a Traditional IRA (non-deductible), then convert it to a Roth. This is legal and commonly used by high earners.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Traditional IRA Deduction Limits</h3>
    
    <p>Anyone can <em>contribute</em> to a Traditional IRA, but your ability to <em>deduct</em> the contribution depends on whether you (or your spouse) have access to a workplace retirement plan:</p>

    <p><strong>If you ARE covered by a workplace plan:</strong></p>
    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Filing Status</th><th>Full Deduction</th><th>Partial Deduction</th><th>No Deduction</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Single/Head of Household</td><td>Under $79,000</td><td>$79,000 - $89,000</td><td>$89,000+</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Jointly</td><td>Under $126,000</td><td>$126,000 - $146,000</td><td>$146,000+</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>If you are NOT covered but your spouse IS:</strong> Phase-out is $236,000 - $246,000 (MFJ)</p>

    <h2 id="traditional">Traditional IRA: Deep Dive</h2>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You contribute pre-tax dollars (or deduct contributions on your tax return)</li>
      <li>Your investments grow tax-deferred — no annual taxes on gains</li>
      <li>When you withdraw in retirement, the full amount is taxed as ordinary income</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate tax savings:</strong> Every dollar contributed reduces your taxable income this year</li>
      <li><strong>No income limits:</strong> Anyone with earned income can contribute</li>
      <li><strong>Higher effective contribution:</strong> If you're in the 24% bracket, a $7,000 contribution only "costs" you $5,320 after the tax savings</li>
      <li><strong>Lower taxes in retirement:</strong> Many people have lower income in retirement, meaning lower tax rates on withdrawals</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Future tax uncertainty:</strong> Tax rates could increase by the time you retire</li>
      <li><strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):</strong> You must start withdrawing at age 73, even if you don't need the money</li>
      <li><strong>Limited estate planning:</strong> Heirs must pay income tax on inherited Traditional IRA funds</li>
      <li><strong>Less flexible:</strong> Early withdrawals trigger penalties AND taxes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="roth">Roth IRA: Deep Dive</h2>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You contribute after-tax dollars (no deduction)</li>
      <li>Your investments grow tax-free</li>
      <li>Qualified withdrawals in retirement are 100% tax-free</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tax-free retirement income:</strong> Not a single dollar goes to Uncle Sam on qualified withdrawals</li>
      <li><strong>No RMDs:</strong> Never forced to withdraw — great for estate planning</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> You can withdraw your contributions (not earnings) anytime without penalty</li>
      <li><strong>Tax diversification:</strong> Provides tax-free income to manage your bracket in retirement</li>
      <li><strong>Protection against tax increases:</strong> If rates go up, you've already paid at today's lower rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No immediate tax benefit:</strong> You pay full taxes on the money you contribute this year</li>
      <li><strong>Income limits:</strong> High earners may not be able to contribute directly</li>
      <li><strong>5-year rule:</strong> The account must be open for 5 years for earnings to be tax-free</li>
      <li><strong>Lower "effective" contribution:</strong> You're contributing after-tax dollars, so $7,000 really costs you $7,000</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ The 5-Year Rule</h4>
      <p>For Roth IRA earnings to be withdrawn tax-free, the account must have been open for at least 5 years AND you must be 59½ or older. The 5-year clock starts January 1 of the year you made your first Roth contribution.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="scenarios">Which is Better: Real Scenarios</h2>

    <h3>Scenario 1: Young Professional, Early Career</h3>
    <p><strong>Sarah, 26, Software Developer earning $75,000</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently in the 22% tax bracket</li>
      <li>Expects significant salary growth over her career</li>
      <li>40+ years until retirement</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Best Choice: Roth IRA</strong></p>
    <p>Sarah is likely in the lowest tax bracket she'll ever be in. Paying 22% now beats potentially paying 32%+ in retirement. Plus, 40 years of tax-free growth is enormously valuable.</p>

    <h3>Scenario 2: Peak Earning Years</h3>
    <p><strong>Michael, 52, Executive earning $350,000</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently in the 35% tax bracket</li>
      <li>Plans to retire at 62 on a lower income</li>
      <li>Already has $500K in Roth accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Best Choice: Traditional IRA (if deductible) or Backdoor Roth</strong></p>
    <p>Michael's high bracket makes tax deductions valuable. However, income limits likely prevent deductible Traditional contributions. The backdoor Roth strategy may be his best option for tax diversification.</p>

    <h3>Scenario 3: Part-Time Worker</h3>
    <p><strong>Lisa, 35, Part-time teacher earning $28,000</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Currently in the 12% tax bracket</li>
      <li>Expects to work full-time when kids are older</li>
      <li>Spouse earns $90,000</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Best Choice: Roth IRA</strong></p>
    <p>At 12%, Lisa is in a very low bracket. Locking in these low rates with Roth contributions makes sense, especially if she expects higher income later.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="both">Can You Have Both?</h2>

    <p><strong>Yes!</strong> You can contribute to both a Traditional and Roth IRA in the same year, as long as your total combined contributions don't exceed $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+).</p>

    <p>Many financial advisors recommend having <strong>both types</strong> of accounts for tax diversification. This gives you flexibility in retirement to choose which account to withdraw from based on your tax situation each year.</p>

    <h3>Example Split Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Contribute $3,500 to Traditional IRA → get tax deduction now</li>
      <li>Contribute $3,500 to Roth IRA → tax-free income later</li>
      <li>In retirement, withdraw strategically to minimize taxes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="conversions">Roth Conversions Explained</h2>

    <p>A <strong>Roth conversion</strong> means moving money from a Traditional IRA (or 401(k)) to a Roth IRA. You pay taxes on the converted amount now, but future growth and withdrawals are tax-free.</p>

    <h3>When Conversions Make Sense</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low-income years:</strong> Temporarily unemployed, taking a sabbatical, or in early retirement before Social Security</li>
      <li><strong>Stock market drops:</strong> Convert when balances are low, pay less tax, watch tax-free recovery</li>
      <li><strong>Expected tax rate increases:</strong> If you believe future rates will be higher</li>
      <li><strong>Estate planning:</strong> Pass tax-free assets to heirs</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> A conversion doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. You can convert just enough to "fill up" your current tax bracket without pushing into a higher one.
    </div>

    <h2 id="decision">Making Your Decision</h2>

    <h3>Choose Traditional IRA If:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You're in a high tax bracket now (24%+) and expect lower taxes in retirement</li>
      <li>You need the tax deduction to reduce this year's tax bill</li>
      <li>You're close to retirement with limited time for Roth growth</li>
      <li>Your income exceeds Roth limits and you don't want to do backdoor conversions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Choose Roth IRA If:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You're in a low tax bracket now (10-22%) and expect higher taxes later</li>
      <li>You're young with decades of tax-free growth ahead</li>
      <li>You want flexibility to withdraw contributions if needed</li>
      <li>You want to avoid RMDs and maximize estate planning</li>
      <li>You believe tax rates will increase in the future</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>🎯 The Bottom Line</h4>
      <p>There's no universally "better" option — it depends entirely on your situation. When in doubt, split your contributions or prioritize Roth while you're young, then shift toward Traditional as your income grows. The most important thing is to <strong>contribute something</strong> — either account beats having no retirement savings at all.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can I contribute to an IRA if I have a 401(k)?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Having a 401(k) doesn't prevent IRA contributions. However, it may affect whether your Traditional IRA contribution is tax-deductible.</p>

    <h3>What if I contribute too much to my IRA?</h3>
    <p>Excess contributions are subject to a 6% penalty per year until corrected. Contact your broker to withdraw the excess and any earnings before the tax deadline.</p>

    <h3>When is the deadline for IRA contributions?</h3>
    <p>You can contribute for a tax year until the tax filing deadline (typically April 15 of the following year). For 2026, you have until April 15, 2027.</p>

    <h3>Can I change my mind after contributing?</h3>
    <p>Yes! You can recharacterize contributions from Traditional to Roth (or vice versa) until the tax deadline, including extensions.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Both Roth and Traditional IRAs are powerful retirement tools. The Traditional IRA offers immediate tax savings and works best if you expect lower taxes in retirement. The Roth IRA provides tax-free growth and withdrawals, making it ideal if you're in a low bracket now or want flexibility later.</p>

    <p>For most young professionals and middle-income earners, the Roth IRA's long-term benefits often outweigh the immediate deduction of a Traditional IRA. But there's no one-size-fits-all answer — consider your complete financial picture, or consult a financial advisor for personalized guidance.</p>
