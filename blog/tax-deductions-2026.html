    <p>Tax deductions are one of the most powerful tools for reducing your tax bill. Every dollar you deduct is a dollar that's not subject to income tax. Whether you're an employee, self-employed, or retired, understanding available deductions can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>

    <p>This comprehensive guide covers all the major tax deductions available for 2026, including the updated standard deduction amounts, popular itemized deductions, and valuable above-the-line deductions that anyone can claim.</p>

    <h2 id="standard-vs-itemized">Standard vs. Itemized Deductions: Which Should You Choose?</h2>

    <p>Every taxpayer has a choice: take the <strong>standard deduction</strong> (a fixed amount based on filing status) or <strong>itemize deductions</strong> (list individual qualifying expenses). You should choose whichever gives you the larger deduction.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 The Simple Rule:</strong> If your itemized deductions (mortgage interest, state taxes, charitable donations, etc.) exceed the standard deduction, itemize. Otherwise, take the standard deduction — it's simpler and you'll save more.
    </div>

    <p>Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act nearly doubled the standard deduction, approximately <strong>90% of taxpayers</strong> now take the standard deduction. However, if you have a mortgage, live in a high-tax state, or make significant charitable contributions, itemizing may still benefit you.</p>

    <h2 id="standard-deduction">2026 Standard Deduction Amounts</h2>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Filing Status</th><th>2026 Amount</th><th>Change from 2025</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Single</td><td><strong>$16,100</strong></td><td>+$350</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Jointly</td><td><strong>$32,200</strong></td><td>+$700</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Married Filing Separately</td><td><strong>$16,100</strong></td><td>+$350</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Head of Household</td><td><strong>$24,150</strong></td><td>+$525</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Additional Standard Deduction for Age/Blindness</h3>
    <p>If you're 65 or older, or legally blind, you qualify for an additional standard deduction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single/Head of Household:</strong> Additional $2,000 per qualifying condition</li>
      <li><strong>Married (Joint or Separate):</strong> Additional $1,600 per qualifying spouse per condition</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Example: A married couple filing jointly, both over 65, would get: $32,200 + $1,600 + $1,600 = $35,400</em></p>

    <h2 id="above-the-line">Above-the-Line Deductions</h2>

    <p><strong>Above-the-line deductions</strong> (also called adjustments to income) are special because you can claim them <em>even if you take the standard deduction</em>. They reduce your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), which can also help you qualify for other tax benefits.</p>

    <div class="deduction-card">
      <h4>💰 Traditional IRA Contributions</h4>
      <p class="amount">Up to $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)</p>
      <p>Contributions to a traditional IRA are deductible if you meet income requirements. This deduction phases out at higher incomes if you (or your spouse) have access to a workplace retirement plan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="deduction-card">
      <h4>🏥 Health Savings Account (HSA) Contributions</h4>
      <p class="amount">$4,300 individual / $8,550 family</p>
      <p>If you have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), HSA contributions are fully deductible. This is one of the only triple tax-advantaged accounts: deduction now, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="deduction-card">
      <h4>🎓 Student Loan Interest</h4>
      <p class="amount">Up to $2,500</p>
      <p>You can deduct interest paid on qualified student loans, even if you don't itemize. This deduction phases out at higher incomes (starting at $80,000 single / $165,000 married).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="deduction-card">
      <h4>👨‍🏫 Educator Expenses</h4>
      <p class="amount">Up to $300 ($600 for married educators)</p>
      <p>K-12 teachers can deduct up to $300 for classroom supplies, books, computer equipment, and professional development courses purchased out of pocket.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="deduction-card">
      <h4>💼 Self-Employment Tax</h4>
      <p class="amount">50% of SE tax paid</p>
      <p>Self-employed individuals can deduct half of the self-employment tax they pay. This mirrors the employer portion that W-2 employees don't see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="deduction-card">
      <h4>🏥 Self-Employed Health Insurance</h4>
      <p class="amount">100% of premiums</p>
      <p>Self-employed individuals can deduct health insurance premiums for themselves, their spouse, and dependents, even without itemizing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="itemized">Popular Itemized Deductions</h2>

    <p>If your itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction, you'll want to claim these:</p>

    <h3>State and Local Taxes (SALT)</h3>
    <p><strong>Maximum: $10,000</strong> ($5,000 if married filing separately)</p>
    <p>You can deduct state and local income taxes (or sales taxes) plus property taxes, but the total is capped at $10,000. This cap particularly affects taxpayers in high-tax states like California, New York, and New Jersey.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>📊 SALT Deduction Breakdown</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>State income taxes OR state sales taxes (pick one)</li>
        <li>Local income taxes</li>
        <li>Real estate property taxes</li>
        <li>Personal property taxes (e.g., car registration based on value)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Mortgage Interest</h3>
    <p><strong>Limit: Interest on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt</strong></p>
    <p>You can deduct interest paid on your primary residence and one additional home. The $750,000 limit applies to mortgages taken out after December 15, 2017. Older mortgages may qualify for the previous $1 million limit.</p>

    <h3>Charitable Contributions</h3>
    <p><strong>Limit: Up to 60% of AGI for cash donations</strong></p>
    <p>Donations to qualified charitable organizations are deductible. Keep records:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash donations:</strong> Bank record or written receipt required</li>
      <li><strong>Donations over $250:</strong> Written acknowledgment from charity required</li>
      <li><strong>Non-cash donations:</strong> Fair market value; items over $500 require Form 8283</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Medical and Dental Expenses</h3>
    <p><strong>Threshold: Expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI</strong></p>
    <p>Medical expenses are only deductible to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. For someone with $80,000 AGI, only medical expenses above $6,000 would count.</p>

    <p>Qualifying expenses include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Health insurance premiums (not paid pre-tax)</li>
      <li>Doctor visits, surgeries, hospital stays</li>
      <li>Prescription medications</li>

      <li>Transportation for medical care</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Casualty and Theft Losses</h3>
    <p><strong>Limited to federally declared disasters</strong></p>
    <p>Personal casualty losses are only deductible if caused by a federally declared disaster. The loss must exceed $100 per event, and total losses must exceed 10% of AGI.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="self-employed">Self-Employment Deductions</h2>

    <p>Self-employed individuals have access to additional deductions that can significantly reduce taxable income:</p>

    <h3>Home Office Deduction</h3>
    <p>If you use part of your home exclusively and regularly for business, you can deduct related expenses. Two methods are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simplified method:</strong> $5 per square foot, up to 300 sq ft (max $1,500)</li>
      <li><strong>Regular method:</strong> Calculate actual expenses based on percentage of home used</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Business Expenses</h3>
    <p>Ordinary and necessary business expenses are fully deductible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Office supplies and equipment</li>
      <li>Software and subscriptions</li>
      <li>Professional services (accounting, legal)</li>
      <li>Advertising and marketing</li>
      <li>Business travel and meals (50% for meals)</li>
      <li>Professional development and education</li>
      <li>Business insurance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction</h3>
    <p><strong>Up to 20% of qualified business income</strong></p>
    <p>Pass-through business owners (sole proprietors, S-corps, partnerships) may deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income. This valuable deduction has income limitations and phase-outs for certain service businesses.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ QBI Limitations</h4>
      <p>The full 20% deduction phases out for specified service trades (law, health, consulting, etc.) starting at $191,950 single / $383,900 married. Above these thresholds, complex calculations apply.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Retirement Plan Contributions</h3>
    <p>Self-employed individuals can contribute to special retirement accounts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SEP-IRA:</strong> Up to 25% of net self-employment income (max $70,000)</li>
      <li><strong>Solo 401(k):</strong> Employee contributions ($23,500) plus employer contributions (25% of compensation)</li>
      <li><strong>SIMPLE IRA:</strong> Up to $16,500 ($20,000 if 50+)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="education">Education-Related Deductions and Credits</h2>

    <p>While education credits (American Opportunity, Lifetime Learning) are often more valuable, some education deductions remain available:</p>

    <h3>Student Loan Interest</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, up to $2,500 of student loan interest is deductible above-the-line. This includes interest on loans for yourself, spouse, or dependents.</p>

    <h3>Work-Related Education</h3>
    <p>If you're self-employed or have unreimbursed employee expenses (rare after 2017 tax reform), education that maintains or improves skills for your current job may be deductible as a business expense.</p>

    <h3>529 Plan Benefits</h3>
    <p>While contributions aren't federally deductible, many states offer state tax deductions for 529 plan contributions. Earnings grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are tax-free.</p>

    <h2 id="homeowner">Homeowner Deductions</h2>

    <h3>Mortgage Interest</h3>
    <p>The mortgage interest deduction remains one of the largest itemized deductions. To qualify:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loan must be secured by your main home or second home</li>
      <li>Debt limit: $750,000 (or $1M for loans before Dec 2017)</li>
      <li>Includes interest on home equity loans used to buy, build, or improve your home</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Property Taxes</h3>
    <p>Real estate taxes are deductible as part of the SALT deduction, subject to the $10,000 cap. This includes property taxes on your primary residence and any additional properties.</p>

    <h3>Mortgage Insurance Premiums</h3>
    <p>Private mortgage insurance (PMI) may be deductible if your AGI is below certain limits. Check current legislation as this deduction has been extended and expired multiple times.</p>

    <h3>Home Office (Self-Employed Only)</h3>
    <p>Remote employees cannot deduct home office expenses, but self-employed individuals can. The space must be used regularly and exclusively for business.</p>

    <h2 id="strategies">Tax Deduction Strategies</h2>

    <h3>1. Bunching Deductions</h3>
    <p>If you're close to the standard deduction threshold, consider "bunching" — concentrating deductible expenses into alternating years to exceed the standard deduction in some years.</p>
    
    <p><em>Example: Make two years' worth of charitable donations in one year, itemize that year, take the standard deduction the next year.</em></p>

    <h3>2. Donor-Advised Funds</h3>
    <p>Contribute a large amount to a donor-advised fund in one year (getting a big deduction), then distribute to charities over multiple years. You get the tax benefit upfront while maintaining flexibility in giving.</p>

    <h3>3. Maximize Retirement Contributions</h3>
    <p>Retirement contributions provide above-the-line deductions that reduce AGI. Lower AGI can help you qualify for other credits and deductions with income limits.</p>

    <h3>4. HSA Strategy</h3>
    <p>If eligible, contribute the maximum to your HSA even if you don't have current medical expenses. The funds can be invested and grow tax-free for decades, then used tax-free for medical expenses in retirement.</p>

    <h3>5. Time Your Income and Deductions</h3>
    <p>If you have flexibility (common for self-employed), consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accelerating deductions into high-income years</li>
      <li>Deferring income to lower-income years</li>
      <li>Bunching business expenses before year-end</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>📝 Record-Keeping Tips</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep receipts for all deductible expenses</li>
        <li>Use a dedicated credit card for business expenses</li>
        <li>Log mileage if deducting vehicle expenses</li>
        <li>Take photos of donated items with receipts</li>
        <li>Save Form 1098 (mortgage interest) and property tax statements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Deductions to Watch in 2026</h2>

    <p>Tax law changes frequently. Here are deductions that may change or require attention:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>SALT Cap:</strong> The $10,000 limit was made permanent by OBBBA but could be revisited</li>
      <li><strong>Electric Vehicle Credits:</strong> Complex requirements around manufacturing continue to evolve</li>
      <li><strong>Energy Efficiency Credits:</strong> Credits for home improvements (heat pumps, insulation, etc.) remain available</li>
      <li><strong>QBI Deduction:</strong> Made permanent, but always verify income limits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>Maximizing your tax deductions requires understanding what's available and strategic planning. For most taxpayers, the standard deduction provides the best value. However, if you have significant mortgage interest, state taxes, or charitable contributions, itemizing may save you more.</p>

    <p>Above-the-line deductions like retirement contributions and HSA contributions are valuable for everyone. Self-employed individuals have access to additional deductions that can dramatically reduce taxable income.</p>

    <p>The key to maximizing deductions is good record-keeping throughout the year. Don't wait until April to think about your taxes — plan ahead, track expenses, and consult a tax professional for personalized advice.</p>
