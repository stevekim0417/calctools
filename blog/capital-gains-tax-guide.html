    <h2 id="what-are">What Are Capital Gains?</h2>
    
    <p>A <strong>capital gain</strong> occurs when you sell a "capital asset" for more than its original purchase price (called the "cost basis"). Capital assets include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Investments:</strong> Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs</li>
      <li><strong>Real estate:</strong> Homes, rental properties, land</li>
      <li><strong>Personal property:</strong> Cars, jewelry, collectibles, art</li>
      <li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> Bitcoin, Ethereum, other digital assets</li>
      <li><strong>Business assets:</strong> Equipment, intellectual property</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>📊 The Basic Formula</h4>
      <p><strong>Capital Gain = Sale Price − Cost Basis − Selling Expenses</strong></p>
      <p>If the result is negative, you have a <strong>capital loss</strong>, which can offset other gains or reduce taxable income.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>You bought 100 shares of ABC stock for $50/share ($5,000 total) and sold them for $80/share ($8,000 total), paying $10 in commissions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sale price: $8,000</li>
      <li>Cost basis: $5,000</li>
      <li>Expenses: $10</li>
      <li><strong>Capital gain: $2,990</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="short-vs-long">Short-Term vs. Long-Term Capital Gains</h2>

    <p>The tax rate on your capital gain depends on how long you held the asset before selling it:</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Holding Period</th><th>Classification</th><th>Tax Rate</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1 year or less</td><td><strong>Short-Term</strong></td><td>Ordinary income rates (10%-37%)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>More than 1 year</td><td><strong>Long-Term</strong></td><td>Preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> The difference can be huge. A taxpayer in the 32% bracket pays only 15% on long-term gains — a savings of 17 percentage points. On a $50,000 gain, that's $8,500 in tax savings just by holding an extra day!
    </div>

    <h3>How the Holding Period Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The clock starts the day <em>after</em> you purchase</li>
      <li>The clock stops the day you sell</li>
      <li>You need to hold for <strong>at least one year and one day</strong> for long-term treatment</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you buy stock on January 15, 2026, you must wait until at least January 16, 2027 to sell for long-term capital gains treatment.</p>

    <h2 id="rates-2026">2026 Capital Gains Tax Rates</h2>

    <h3>Short-Term Capital Gains (Held ≤1 Year)</h3>
    <p>Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, using the same brackets as your wages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, or 37% depending on your total taxable income</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-Term Capital Gains (Held >1 Year)</h3>
    <p>Long-term gains receive preferential tax rates:</p>

    <table class="tax-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Tax Rate</th><th>Single Filers</th><th>Married Filing Jointly</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>0%</strong></td><td>$0 – $48,350</td><td>$0 – $96,700</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>15%</strong></td><td>$48,351 – $533,400</td><td>$96,701 – $600,050</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>20%</strong></td><td>Over $533,400</td><td>Over $600,050</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>🎯 The 0% Rate Sweet Spot</h4>
      <p>If your total taxable income (including capital gains) stays below $48,350 (single) or $96,700 (married), your long-term gains are taxed at <strong>0%</strong>. This is a powerful opportunity for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retirees with modest income</li>
        <li>Early retirees before Social Security begins</li>
        <li>Students or those with gap years</li>
        <li>Strategic "tax gain harvesting" to reset cost basis</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="calculate">How to Calculate Capital Gains Tax</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Determine Your Cost Basis</h3>
    <p>Cost basis is typically what you paid, plus certain adjustments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purchase price</strong> of the asset</li>
      <li><strong>Transaction costs:</strong> Commissions, fees</li>
      <li><strong>Improvements:</strong> For real estate, capital improvements increase basis</li>
      <li><strong>Reinvested dividends:</strong> If dividends were reinvested, add them to basis</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 2: Calculate Your Gain or Loss</h3>
    <p><strong>Gain/Loss = Net Proceeds − Adjusted Cost Basis</strong></p>

    <h3>Step 3: Categorize as Short-Term or Long-Term</h3>
    <p>Check how long you held the asset (more than 1 year = long-term).</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Net Your Gains and Losses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term gains and losses are netted together</li>
      <li>Long-term gains and losses are netted together</li>
      <li>If one category has a net loss, it offsets gains in the other category</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 5: Apply the Appropriate Rate</h3>
    <p>Apply short-term rates to net short-term gains and long-term rates to net long-term gains.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="niit">Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)</h2>

    <p>High earners face an additional <strong>3.8% Net Investment Income Tax</strong> on top of regular capital gains taxes.</p>

    <h3>Who Pays NIIT?</h3>
    <p>NIIT applies when your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) exceeds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single:</strong> $200,000</li>
      <li><strong>Married Filing Jointly:</strong> $250,000</li>
      <li><strong>Head of Household:</strong> $200,000</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Income Is Subject to NIIT?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Capital gains</li>
      <li>Dividends</li>
      <li>Interest (excluding municipal bonds)</li>
      <li>Rental income</li>
      <li>Royalties</li>
      <li>Passive business income</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ Total Tax on Long-Term Gains for High Earners</h4>
      <p>If you're subject to NIIT and in the 20% long-term bracket, your effective rate is:</p>
      <p><strong>20% + 3.8% = 23.8%</strong></p>
      <p>Still much better than the 37% top ordinary income rate!</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="special">Special Situations</h2>

    <h3>Primary Residence Exclusion</h3>
    <p>When you sell your primary home, you can exclude significant gains from taxes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single:</strong> Exclude up to $250,000 in gains</li>
      <li><strong>Married Filing Jointly:</strong> Exclude up to $500,000 in gains</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Owned the home for at least 2 of the last 5 years</li>
      <li>Lived in it as your primary residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years</li>
      <li>Haven't used this exclusion in the past 2 years</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Inherited Assets: Step-Up in Basis</h3>
    <p>When you inherit an asset, your cost basis "steps up" to the fair market value at the time of death. This can eliminate years of appreciation from capital gains.</p>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Example:</strong> Your grandmother bought stock for $10,000 in 1980, worth $200,000 when she passed. Your cost basis is $200,000, not $10,000. If you sell for $205,000, you only pay tax on $5,000 in gains — not $195,000.
    </div>

    <h3>Collectibles and Precious Metals</h3>
    <p>Long-term gains on collectibles (art, antiques, coins, etc.) are taxed at a maximum rate of <strong>28%</strong>, not the standard 0/15/20% rates.</p>

    <h3>Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)</h3>
    <p>Gains from qualified small business stock held more than 5 years may be <strong>100% excluded</strong> from federal tax (up to $10 million or 10x your basis).</p>

    <h2 id="strategies">Tax-Saving Strategies</h2>

    <h3>1. Hold for Long-Term Treatment</h3>
    <p>The simplest strategy: hold investments for more than one year to qualify for lower long-term rates.</p>

    <h3>2. Tax-Loss Harvesting</h3>
    <p>Sell losing investments to offset gains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Losses first offset gains of the same type (short-term vs. long-term)</li>
      <li>Excess losses offset the other type</li>
      <li>Up to $3,000 of net losses can offset ordinary income annually</li>
      <li>Remaining losses carry forward indefinitely</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ Watch the Wash Sale Rule</h4>
      <p>You can't claim a loss if you buy a "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale. The IRS disallows the loss in this case.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Tax Gain Harvesting</h3>
    <p>If you're in a low-income year (retired early, job gap, etc.), you may be in the 0% long-term bracket. Strategically selling winners to "harvest gains" at 0% resets your cost basis higher.</p>

    <h3>4. Hold Investments in Tax-Advantaged Accounts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>401(k), IRA:</strong> Gains grow tax-deferred (or tax-free for Roth)</li>
      <li><strong>HSA:</strong> Gains are tax-free if used for medical expenses</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Asset Location Strategy</h3>
    <p>Place investments strategically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tax-advantaged accounts:</strong> High-yield bonds, REITs (taxed as ordinary income)</li>
      <li><strong>Taxable accounts:</strong> Growth stocks, index funds (tax-efficient, lower turnover)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Donate Appreciated Assets</h3>
    <p>Donating appreciated stock to charity lets you deduct the full market value without paying capital gains tax on the appreciation.</p>

    <h3>7. Qualified Opportunity Zones</h3>
    <p>Reinvesting gains into Qualified Opportunity Zone funds can defer and potentially reduce capital gains taxes.</p>

    <h2 id="losses">Capital Losses: Turning Lemons into Lemonade</h2>

    <p>Capital losses aren't just bad news — they're a tax planning tool:</p>

    <h3>How Losses Work</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Short-term losses offset short-term gains first</li>
      <li>Long-term losses offset long-term gains first</li>
      <li>Net losses from one category offset gains in the other</li>
      <li>Up to $3,000 of net losses offset ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately)</li>
      <li>Excess losses carry forward to future years</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="key-point">
      <strong>💡 Strategy:</strong> If you have both gains and losses, consider whether it's better to offset short-term gains (taxed at higher ordinary rates) or let them offset long-term gains. Sometimes harvesting short-term losses specifically is more valuable.
    </div>

    <h2 id="crypto">Cryptocurrency and Capital Gains</h2>

    <p>The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, not currency. This means:</p>

    <h3>Taxable Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Selling crypto for cash:</strong> Capital gain/loss</li>
      <li><strong>Trading one crypto for another:</strong> Capital gain/loss</li>
      <li><strong>Using crypto to buy goods/services:</strong> Capital gain/loss</li>
      <li><strong>Receiving crypto as payment:</strong> Ordinary income + future capital gain/loss</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Non-Taxable Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Buying crypto with cash</li>
      <li>Transferring between your own wallets</li>
      <li>Gifting (though recipient may owe later)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cost Basis Methods</h3>
    <p>For crypto, you can typically use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FIFO (First In, First Out):</strong> Sell oldest coins first</li>
      <li><strong>Specific Identification:</strong> Choose which coins to sell</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <h4>⚠️ Crypto Reporting</h4>
      <p>Starting in 2026, cryptocurrency exchanges must report transactions to the IRS via Form 1099-DA. Keep detailed records of all your transactions!</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Do I owe capital gains on investments I haven't sold?</h3>
    <p>No. Capital gains tax is only triggered when you sell. Unrealized gains (paper profits) are not taxed until you realize them by selling.</p>

    <h3>What if I sell at a loss?</h3>
    <p>Losses can offset gains and up to $3,000 can offset ordinary income. Excess losses carry forward to future years.</p>

    <h3>Are dividends taxed as capital gains?</h3>
    <p><strong>Qualified dividends</strong> receive the same preferential rates as long-term capital gains. <strong>Ordinary dividends</strong> are taxed as ordinary income.</p>

    <h3>How do I report capital gains?</h3>
    <p>Report capital gains and losses on <strong>Schedule D</strong> of Form 1040, with details on <strong>Form 8949</strong>. Your broker provides Form 1099-B with transaction details.</p>

    <h3>Can I avoid capital gains by reinvesting?</h3>
    <p>Generally no — selling triggers the tax even if you immediately reinvest. Exception: 1031 exchanges for real estate and Opportunity Zone investments can defer gains.</p>

    <h3>What about state capital gains taxes?</h3>
    <p>Most states tax capital gains as ordinary income. Some states (like Washington) have separate capital gains taxes. A few states (like Florida and Texas) have no income tax at all.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    
    <p>Capital gains taxes are a crucial consideration for any investor. Key takeaways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Holding period matters:</strong> Long-term gains (>1 year) are taxed at preferential 0%, 15%, or 20% rates</li>
      <li><strong>Short-term gains</strong> are taxed at your ordinary income rate (up to 37%)</li>
      <li><strong>High earners</strong> may owe an additional 3.8% NIIT</li>
      <li><strong>Tax-loss harvesting</strong> can offset gains and reduce taxes</li>
      <li><strong>Special rules</strong> apply to home sales, inheritances, and collectibles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Smart tax planning throughout the year — not just at tax time — can significantly reduce your capital gains tax burden while keeping your investment strategy on track.</p>
