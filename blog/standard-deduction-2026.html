    </div>

    <p>The <strong>standard deduction</strong> is one of the most important tax benefits available to American taxpayers. For 2026, the IRS has increased the standard deduction amounts to account for inflation, putting more money back in your pocket.</p>

    <h2>2026 Standard Deduction Amounts</h2>

    <table class="comparison-table">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Filing Status</th><th>2026 Amount</th><th>2025 Amount</th><th>Increase</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Single</strong></td><td>$16,100</td><td>$15,750</td><td>+$350</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Married Filing Jointly</strong></td><td>$32,200</td><td>$31,500</td><td>+$700</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Married Filing Separately</strong></td><td>$16,100</td><td>$15,750</td><td>+$350</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Head of Household</strong></td><td>$24,150</td><td>$23,625</td><td>+$525</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>👴 Additional Deduction for Seniors (65+)</h4>
      <p>If you're 65 or older, you get an <strong>extra</strong> standard deduction:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single/Head of Household:</strong> +$2,050</li>
        <li><strong>Married (per qualifying spouse):</strong> +$1,650</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A married couple where both spouses are 65+ gets an additional $3,300 ($1,650 × 2).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What is the Standard Deduction?</h2>

    <p>The standard deduction is a <strong>flat dollar amount</strong> that reduces your taxable income. Think of it as the government's way of saying "we won't tax you on this portion of your income."</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you're single and earn $60,000, your taxable income becomes:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; text-align: center; background: #f7fafc; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
      $60,000 − $16,100 = <strong>$43,900</strong> taxable income
    </p>

    <h2>Standard Deduction vs. Itemizing: Which is Better?</h2>

    <p>You can choose between the standard deduction OR itemized deductions — whichever gives you a bigger tax break. You can't use both.</p>

    <div class="vs-grid">
      <div class="vs-card standard">
        <h4>✅ Standard Deduction</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple — no receipts needed</li>
          <li>Fixed amount based on filing status</li>
          <li>Best for most taxpayers (~90%)</li>
          <li>No audit risk from deduction claims</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="vs-card itemized">
        <h4>📝 Itemized Deductions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Must track and prove expenses</li>
          <li>Only worth it if total exceeds standard</li>
          <li>Common items: mortgage interest, state taxes, charity</li>
          <li>SALT cap: $10,000 limit</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="decision-box">
      <h4>🤔 Should You Itemize? Quick Test</h4>
      <p>Add up your potential itemized deductions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mortgage interest paid</li>
        <li>State and local taxes (max $10,000)</li>
        <li>Charitable donations</li>
        <li>Medical expenses (over 7.5% of income)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If your total exceeds $16,100 (single) or $32,200 (married), itemize. Otherwise, take the standard deduction.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who Can't Use the Standard Deduction?</h2>

    <p>Most taxpayers can claim the standard deduction, but there are exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Married filing separately</strong> — if your spouse itemizes, you must also itemize</li>
      <li><strong>Nonresident aliens</strong> — must itemize (with some exceptions)</li>
      <li><strong>Short tax year filers</strong> — due to change in accounting period</li>
      <li><strong>Estates and trusts</strong> — different rules apply</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Itemized Deductions for 2026</h2>

    <h3>1. State and Local Taxes (SALT)</h3>
    <p>You can deduct state income taxes (or sales tax) plus property taxes, but the <strong>total is capped at $10,000</strong> ($5,000 if married filing separately).</p>

    <h3>2. Mortgage Interest</h3>
    <p>Interest on up to $750,000 of mortgage debt (for homes purchased after Dec 15, 2017) is deductible. This is often the biggest itemized deduction for homeowners.</p>

    <h3>3. Charitable Contributions</h3>
    <p>Cash donations to qualified charities are generally deductible up to 60% of your adjusted gross income. Keep receipts for donations over $250.</p>

    <h3>4. Medical Expenses</h3>
    <p>Only medical expenses exceeding <strong>7.5% of your adjusted gross income</strong> are deductible. For most people, this threshold is hard to reach.</p>

    <h2>Standard Deduction Strategy Tips</h2>

    <h3>Tip 1: Bunching Deductions</h3>
    <p>If you're close to the itemizing threshold, consider "bunching" — making two years' worth of charitable donations in one year. Take the standard deduction in the off-year, itemize in the bunching year.</p>

    <h3>Tip 2: Donor-Advised Funds</h3>
    <p>Contribute a large amount to a donor-advised fund in one year (get the deduction immediately), then distribute to charities over multiple years.</p>

    <h3>Tip 3: Time Major Expenses</h3>
    <p>If you know you'll have large medical expenses or plan to pay property taxes, timing them strategically can help you exceed the standard deduction threshold.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>Can I take the standard deduction and still deduct student loan interest?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Student loan interest (up to $2,500) is an "above-the-line" deduction. You can take it regardless of whether you itemize or use the standard deduction.</p>

    <h3>Does the standard deduction reduce my refund?</h3>
    <p>The standard deduction reduces your <em>taxable income</em>, which reduces your tax liability. This can result in a larger refund if you've been over-withholding.</p>

    <h3>What if I'm claimed as a dependent?</h3>
    <p>If someone else claims you as a dependent, your standard deduction is limited to the greater of $1,350 or your earned income plus $450, up to the normal standard deduction amount.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>For 2026, the standard deduction offers significant tax savings with zero paperwork:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single:</strong> $16,100</li>
      <li><strong>Married Filing Jointly:</strong> $32,200</li>
      <li><strong>Head of Household:</strong> $24,150</li>
    </ul>

    <p>About 90% of taxpayers benefit more from the standard deduction than itemizing. Unless you have substantial mortgage interest, property taxes, or charitable donations, the standard deduction is likely your best choice.</p>
